# Copilot Useful GitHub Instructions

## Committing Changes

- Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages in English.
- Use the imperative mood in commit messages (e.g., "Add section for work experience").
- Group related changes into a single commit; avoid large, unrelated changes in one commit.
- Reference related issues or pull requests in commit messages when appropriate.
- Follow the zephyr commit message guidelines: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/contribute/guidelines.html
- Check the spelling and grammar of commit messages and the changed setions before committing.

## Branching and Pull Requests

- Create feature branches for new features or major changes (e.g., `feature/add-education-section`).
- Use pull requests for merging changes into the main branch; request reviews if collaborating.
- Write clear descriptions for pull requests, summarizing the changes and their purpose.

## Repository Hygiene

- Regularly pull the latest changes from the main branch to avoid merge conflicts.
- Remove unused branches after merging.
- Do not commit sensitive or personal information.
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude files and folders that should not be tracked (e.g., build artifacts, temporary files).

## Collaboration

- Communicate with collaborators using issues and pull request comments.
- Assign reviewers and use labels to organize and prioritize work.
- Document major changes in the `README.md` or a `CHANGELOG.md` file.
